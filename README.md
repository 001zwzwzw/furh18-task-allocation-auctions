# Task Allocation using Auctions
Dynamic decentralized task allocation algorithms for multi-agent systems using auctions and machine learning.

Master's research at The University of Texas at Austin in the research group of Efstathios Bakolas.

A paper resulting from these simulations is expected to be published by the end of 2020.

* For the dynamic task allocation, run `OptimalControl_DTA.m'.
* For the sensitivity analysis of the parameters, run `optimalControlParametersAnalysis.m'.
